# Tic-Tac-Toe

The curriculum is taken from The Odin Project's Fullstack Course, [link.](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/tic-tac-toe)

This project's purpose is to utilize both the Module Pattern and the Factory Pattern in building a desktop version of the game Tic-Tac-Toe. The game logic is written in JavaScript, as well as most of the DOM features which are dynamically generated.
