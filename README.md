# Tic-Tac-Toe

A Tic-Tac-Toe game created for Desktop. This project's purpose is to utilize both the Module Pattern and the Factory Pattern in building a desktop version of the game Tic-Tac-Toe.

The idea is taken from The Odin Project's Fullstack Course, [link.](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/tic-tac-toe)
